- `GET /api/swaps?tokenAddress={address}` - Get swap events for a token
- `GET /api/swaps/latest-price?tokenAddress={address}` - Get latest price for a token
- `GET /api/swaps/candles?tokenAddress={address}&timeframe=1h` - Get candlestick data

## Additional Information

For more details about the SARA protocol, please refer to the contract documentation.

## Server API

The project includes a TypeScript-based Express server that provides API endpoints for swap events and price data. The server is built with the following architecture:

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/swaps` - Save a new swap event
- `GET /api/swaps` - Get swap events for a token
- `GET /api/price/:tokenAddress` - Get latest price for a token
- `GET /api/candles/:tokenAddress` - Get candle data for charts

### Running the Server

Development mode:
```bash
npm run server
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm run server:prod
```

### Server Configuration

The server uses MongoDB to store swap events and provides real-time price data for tokens. You can configure the MongoDB connection by setting the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable or it will default to `mongodb://localhost:27017/sara_db`.

### Server Build Process

The server TypeScript files are compiled using a dedicated tsconfig:
```bash
npm run build:server
```

This creates JavaScript files in the `dist/api` directory that are used in production.
