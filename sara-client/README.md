## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sara-client
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install MongoDB locally or use MongoDB Atlas
   - Create a database named "sara"
   - Set the MongoDB URI in your environment variables (optional):
     ```
     export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sara
     ```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start:
- The Vite frontend development server
- The Express API server for storing and retrieving swap events

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install MongoDB locally or use MongoDB Atlas
   - Create a database named "sara"
   - Set the MongoDB URI in your environment variables (optional):
     ```
     export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sara
     ```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start:
- The Vite frontend development server
- The Express API server for storing and retrieving swap events

## Features

- Trade tokens using the SARA DEX
- View real-time price charts with multiple timeframes
- See complete trade history for tokens
- Buy and sell creator tokens with CORAL

## Price Charts and Trade History

The application now includes:
- Real-time price updates using lightweight-charts
- MongoDB integration for persistent storage of swap events
- RESTful API for retrieving historical price data
- Candlestick charts with multiple timeframe options

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/swaps` - Save a swap event
- `GET /api/swaps?tokenAddress={address}` - Get swap events for a token
- `GET /api/swaps/latest-price?tokenAddress={address}` - Get latest price for a token
- `GET /api/swaps/candles?tokenAddress={address}&timeframe=1h` - Get candlestick data

## Additional Information

For more details about the SARA protocol, please refer to the contract documentation.

## Server API

The project includes a TypeScript-based Express server that provides API endpoints for swap events and price data. The server is built with the following architecture:

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/swaps` - Save a new swap event
- `GET /api/swaps` - Get swap events for a token
- `GET /api/price/:tokenAddress` - Get latest price for a token
- `GET /api/candles/:tokenAddress` - Get candle data for charts

### Running the Server

Development mode:
```bash
npm run server
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm run server:prod
```

### Server Configuration

The server uses MongoDB to store swap events and provides real-time price data for tokens. You can configure the MongoDB connection by setting the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable or it will default to `mongodb://localhost:27017/sara_db`.

### Server Build Process

The server TypeScript files are compiled using a dedicated tsconfig:
```bash
npm run build:server
```

This creates JavaScript files in the `dist/api` directory that are used in production.
