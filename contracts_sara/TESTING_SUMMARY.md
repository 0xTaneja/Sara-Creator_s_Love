# Sara Contracts Testing Summary

## Successful Operations
1. **Token Minting**: Successfully minted a new creator token with unique name and channel.
2. **Pool Tracking**: Successfully added the pool to tracking using `addPoolToTracking`.
3. **Liquidity Addition**: Successfully added liquidity to the pool (20 CORAL + 20 creator tokens).
4. **Token Listing**: Successfully listed the token through the router.

## Contract Constants
- **MIN_SWAP_AMOUNT**: 0.001 CORAL
- **MAX_SINGLE_SWAP**: 1000.0 CORAL
- **MAX_SWAP_AMOUNT_PERCENT**: 5% (of the pool reserves)
- **MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_SWAPS**: 60 seconds
- **Current swap fee**: 30 (likely 0.3%)

## Swap Issues
We encountered errors when trying to execute swaps:

1. **Slippage Error**: When trying with explicit slippage protection, we get "Slippage too high".
2. **Custom Error**: When trying with zero slippage protection, we get a custom error with signature `0xe450d38c`.

## Validation Checks
- Our swap amounts are valid according to `isValidSwapAmount`.
- There's no time restriction preventing swaps.
- The DEX has the LIQUIDITY_MANAGER_ROLE.
- The pool is properly tracked and has reserves.

## Next Steps

1. **Contract Code Review**: Review the `SaraDEX.sol` contract code to understand the custom error with signature `0xe450d38c`.

2. **Alternative Swap Approach**: Try using the router for swaps instead of directly using the DEX.

3. **Debugging Options**:
   - Try with different token pairs
   - Try with smaller amounts
   - Check if there are any access control issues
   - Verify if there are any additional requirements for swaps not covered in our tests

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - There might be a minimum time requirement after adding liquidity before swaps are allowed
   - There might be additional roles or permissions needed
   - The contract might have additional validation logic not exposed through public functions

## Successful Parts of the System
Despite the swap issues, we've confirmed that the following parts of the system work correctly:
- Token minting
- Pool tracking
- Liquidity addition
- Token listing

This suggests that the core infrastructure is working, and the issue is specific to the swap functionality.
